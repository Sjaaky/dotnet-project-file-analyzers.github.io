# Proj1200: Exclude private assets as project file dependency
Private assets (such as analyzers) are package references that have an effect
on compiling a .NET assembly, but are not needed by the compiled artifact. By
marking them in the project file as private asset it will not become a runtime
dependency, that is linked to a package, or shipped when publishing it.

## Non-compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PackageReference Include="DotNetProjectFile.Analyzers" Version="*" />

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PackageReference Include="DotNetProjectFile.Analyzers" Version="*" PrivateAssets="all" />

</Project>
```

or

``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PackageReference Include="DotNetProjectFile.Analyzers" Version="*">
    <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
  </PackageReference>

</Project>
```
